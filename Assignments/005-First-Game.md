## First Game
- **Due**: June 12<sup>th</sup> by 11:59 p.m. (Sunday Night).
- **Late Projects:** Will NOT be graded. 

### Guidelines
- Projects that are not on github, will not be graded. 
- Projects that do not run, will not be graded.
- You can work in groups of 2-3 not 4. Don't ask.
- All work is expected to be done solely by the individuals in the group. Any collaboration with other groups will result in a grade of 0 (zero) on the assignment.
- Each project will also contain a references file called `references.md` in which all websites in which your group obtianed example code from will be listed in a numbered list.
- Your program will be commented, and again, any help obtained should be cited in the comments.

### Important
- Each member of the group will have a copy of the code in their repository and on their server. 
- The poor member who doesn't have a copy will get a zero. So don't do that to your self.
- To finalize your submission, your group (only one person needs to do this) will send me an email with the following information:
- **Subject:** 2D Program 1
- The body of your email will contain everyone's name, a link to the game on their server, and a link to their github repo.
- Example email below:

### Starter Code
The finished code is available [here](https://github.com/rugbyprof/Mwsu-Mobile-Gaming/tree/master/Example_code/Program_1_Starter)


Using the starter code provided above, program the following additions:
- Change the sprite for the gold coin and make something else like a gem or a mushroom for example.
- Change the sprite for the player and make it some monster or person.
- Change the sprite for the enemies and make it something interesting
- Instead of re-starting the game every time the player dies, add a death counter and simply count the deaths. 
    - Place the death counter at the bottom right hand side of the game, using the same font as the score.
- Since we never restart the game, lets add a timer to stop the game after 2 minutes. 
    - Place this timer at the top right of the game and have it counting down from 120 in seconds. 
- Lastly, instead of your player dying when it falls down the hole at the bottom, respawn the player at some random location on the game board.
